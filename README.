PII Log Analyser – GenAI-Powered, No-Code Tool

This is a complete, beginner-friendly PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection tool built for non-coders using GenAI. It scans logs, detects sensitive data like emails and credit cards, assigns risk levels, redacts data, auto-generates reports, syncs to a dashboard, and visualizes results — all in one tap.
